<h4> State Diagram </h4> 
<p> In some media players there are two major states, when the <b>control shown</b> and <b>control hidden</b> states. In the control shown state this is when the user is able to control the video. Within this state there are multiple states: </p> 
<ul>
    <li>Idle/Paused: When the media is stopped </li>
    <li>Playback: When the media is playing </li>
    <li>(Optional) Rewinding: When the media is playing backwards </li>
    <li>(Optional) Fast Forwarding: When the media is playing ahead </li>
</ul>

<p> For video media players there are also options to change states between having the video play full screen and the video playing at the specifed size.</p>

<h3> Variants <small> how it varies per location </small> </h3>

<h3> Priority Metrics <small> Media and its Usability Metrics </small> </h3>

  <p> 
    For most users, media players are used to do one thing, to play the media that the user wants them to play. That being said, because it is more of a utilitarian component, there are some usability metrics that are not as importnat as others. Some of the important ones are learnability, efficiency, errors, and memorability. 

  </p>
  <p> 
    Media players have to be very learnable, very quickly. For most users, the  media player is only a gateway for them to see the actual content. The quicker it is to learn the software the better. For many of it though it may come very intuitively and if learnability clashed with efficiency I would have to say that efficiency has a higher priority. Similar to buying tickets at a train station or anything like that media players have to do this. derp derp. Its the content thata they want to see that is most important. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    Since it is not so much the media player that is important then the actual content being played, media players must also have to be very efficient. Many of the players today have many shortcuts. Instead of pressing the play button they can have the shortcut of spacebar. Or to scrub through they have arrow bars. These are all very important. This allows the user to quickly access this content and to have quicker responses and feedback. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    Also as far as playing the media, no one wants to encounter through errors. Though errors here will not be as fatal, pausing or stoping when one doesn't want to may be annoying. Also volumne controls may not allow a person to really play the video as intended. Again because the media player in it of itself is a gateway into the actual content, the errors are a basis of not delteing the file and being able to accurately scrub through the video. For it to playback the media at the right speed. etc. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      Yes it should be a memorable interface. Even though you may not have been able to see a media player for a long time, the user should be able to remember what exactly the different functions were. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as I can tell Satistfaction isn't a very important component. Really having the media player show the media that is needed is more important. Having fun or seeing how well it feels isn't at all that important as the other usability metrics.
