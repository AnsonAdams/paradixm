<p class="lead">One of many graphical user interface components that users have had experience with. For example, changing the volume setting on the computer or on a video streaming website.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p> A slider is a control element that uses a knob or lever moved horizontally to control a variable, such as volume on a radio or brightness on a screen.

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<p>Sliders across many different platforms have a minimum(left) value and a maximum value(right). Graphically, the users are exposed with a bar, slider knob, and occasionaly with tick marks. However, different platforms may have different designs to their sliders to follow their human interface guidelines. Underneath, a depiction of three sliders are shown Mac OS X, Windows 8, and iOS 7 & iOS 8.

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<p>The behavior of the slider is very basic. The user is given a choice to either slide left(min) or right(max). By doing so the user can choose the proper setting they are looking for. The slider will not acitvate until the user clicks on the knob and then drags it to their desired setting. Most sliders across different platforms carry the same behavior. We will see how Mac OS X specifically stands out behaviorally in the "Platform-Specfic" section. </p>

<h3>Variants</h3>

<blockquote>There are variants of sliders which perform similar tasks that users might consider over. Since choosing a specific value/preference from a slider can be done by dragging the slider knob. We can achieve the same goal with drop down menus. With drop down menus the user is exposed with links. The user then can scroll through the links to choose the preffered link. Aside from the drop down menus, the spinner is probably the closest component to a slider. The spinner component allows you to hold the up and down keys to increase or decrease a value. The GIF provided underneath depicts how the spinner component works. </blockquote>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

<blockquote>Talk about the five usability metrics in relation to this component. Not all components will have the same
  metric priorities. For example:</blockquote>

<p>Because the button is such a fundamental part of virtually every user interface available today, it can be said that
  all usability metrics are equally important for this component. Users who are seeing a button in a given platform for
  the first time must not have any issues recognizing it and knowing what to do with it (learnability). The high
  priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given.</p>

<p>Users must also never experience undue delays with using a button (efficiency), particularly because using a button
  almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Users should almost never trigger a button by
  mistake (errors)—especially buttons whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world.</p>

<p>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for buttons, it would be satisfaction. The button is such
  a utilitarian component that “fun” or “enjoyment” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this
  prioritization may be for buttons in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g., games, entertainment).
  As a part of that overall system, making buttons “fun” may then become more important than in other situations.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

<blockquote>This section is for describing “what makes for a good <em>your component here</em>?”
  Most likely, this is an amalgam of guidelines documents and platform-independent interaction design
  principles.</blockquote>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
  never doubt whether:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
  <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
    the action that triggers the button</li>
</ol>
<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is where things can get really interesting—platform-specific sections go here. Different versions of
    the same system are considered to be platforms in their own right (e.g., Windows 95 buttons vs. Windows 10
    buttons). Completely customized versions of a component (e.g., a unique-looking/-acting button made specifically
    for a game) are also acceptable here.</p>

  <p>The outline for platform-specific entries resembles the outline already described above, except with a focus
    on how the platform-specific version is <em>different</em>. Thus, you will want some notes on appearance (i.e.,
    more screenshots), behavior, variants, metrics, and characteristics. If some aspect is the same, then say so
    explicitly so that there is no confusion.</p>

  <p>Some platform-specific instances of certain user interface components will merit such a rich discussion that they
    may require a sizable number of supporting assets. In that case, feel free to add subfolders to the main component
    folder, named after the platform under examination.</p>

  <p>This could well be the most distinctive part of the catalog—the sections above this generally appear in user
    interface guidelines, albeit with a platform-specific focus. A key premise of the Paradixm project is to compare
    user interface elements <em>across</em> platforms. Thus, feel free to be creative about presentation here. You
    might want to display a visual gallery, for example, with links leading to individual pages for each covered
    platform-specific user interface component.</p>
