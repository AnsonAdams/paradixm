<h3>Possibly the most important component of any user interface is the button, 
something which triggers an action.</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6">

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote>Buttons tend to look similar throughout many platforms. Usually they are rectangular 
and have a word or an image in them indicating what clicking on the button will actually do.</blockquote>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buttons are sometimes highlighted according to the typical action that a user will take. 
For example,the buttons OK and CANCEL might be right next to each other on a page, but it is 
likely that OK will be highlighted while CANCEL will not be. </p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Events</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A button's event is simply the function of a particular button. </p>

<p>There are two common button events. The first is the "click". This event notifies the computer 
that the button has been triggered and the user wants the computer to perform whatever that button 
is there for. The second event is "hover." If the user interface is well-made, when the user hovers
over a button, the mouse pointer will change shape to let the user know that there is an option
for a "click" event to occur. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>State Diagram</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buttons typically have anywhere between two main states and possibly 2 substates, depending on the device being used. 
The states are as follows: <code>static<code/>, <code>disabled<code/>, <code>hover<code/>, and <code>active<code/>. </p>

  <p>In the <code>static<code/> state, which is the idle or enabled state, the button is ready to be clicked. The <code>disabled<code/>
state is that in which the user is not interacting with a button, or if the button has already been clicked it may not be clicked 
again. </p>


  <p>When a button is in it's <code>static</code> state, additional states may be triggered. They are: </p>
  <ul>
  <li><code>hover</code>: This is the state in which the mouse hovers over the button and either changes the button's color or the pointer's shape
to let the user know that the button is ready to be clicked.</li>

  <li><code>active</code>: This state occurs when a button has already been triggered, or clicked and is attempting to complete it's
action. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Component in Action</h4>

<blockquote>

  <p>For components that are available on a web platform, you can embed an actual component right here, such as:</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="text-center">
  <button class="btn btn-default">OK</button>
  <button class="btn btn-default disabled">Disabled</button>
  <button class="btn btn-success">Success</button>
  <button class="btn btn-danger">Delete</button>
</p>

  </div>

<div class = "row">
  <div class="col-xs-6">
<h3>Variants</h3>

<blockquote>There are many variations of buttons, there isn't just one type. There are 3 main variations and they are as
follows: </blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><em>Buttons</em> indicate an action upon touch and are typically labeled using a text, icon or both.
 are very close to buttons in behaviorâ€”they perform individual action elements upon simple
    invocation by a user. However, they belong to a broader context/structure of a menu, and look sufficiently
    different that they are both conceptually and programmatically viewed as distinct from buttons.</li>

  <li><em>Dropdown Buttons</em> consist of a button that when clicked displays a drop-down list of mutually exclusive items.  
  They sometimes resemble a menu and are sometimes referred to as Menu Buttons.

  <li><em>Toggles</em> allow the user to change a setting between two different states. Toggle buttons are most effective 
  when the on/off states are visually distinct. 
     <div class="container">
        <label class="switch">
         <input type="checkbox" class="switch-input">
         <span class="switch-label" data-on="On" data-off="Off"></span>
         <span class="switch-handle"></span>
        </label>
  
  <li><em>Links</em> allow the user to navigate to a different page with just the one click. Links are very easily 
distinguishable from other buttons because they are usually underlined, blue, and when a mouse pointer hovers over them
the mouse becomes a hand icon. </li>

</ul>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Learnability/Memorability: Buttons are basically a part of every single user interface used today. Because of this buttons should on the most part
be universal. As mentioned above, the typical appearance of a button is a simple shape with some text or an icon inside of it.
Since buttons are typically the same throughout all platforms, it should not be difficult for users to be able to figure
out how to use buttons. 
</p>

<p>Efficiency/Errors: Each button has one action to complete, thus once clicked the action should be performed fairly quickly. 
There should be no delay or too much time waste from the time where the user knows what they want to do and when they actually 
click the button. Relating to that, buttons should be well-labeled and in a position where users will not accidentally mistake
one button for another. For example, everyone knows the placement of the OK and CANCEL buttons, so if one platform were to decide
to switch those, a lot of users would do the wrong action. 
</p>

<p>Satisfaction: Users do not really find any satisfaction in clicking buttons so this metric is not completely applicable to 
buttons. On the other hand, sometimes buttons do crazy things, for example, Google's "I'm feeling lucky" button sometimes shows 
fireworks on the screen, but it won't do that every time. Besides that, satisfaction does not really apply. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
  never doubt whether:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
  <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
    the action that triggers the button</li>
</ol>
  </div>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

<blockquote> 
<h3>Windows 10 </h3>

  <p>As mentioned above, even for Windows 10 buttons, buttons are typically rectangular but sometimes may either have mildly 
rounded corners or really sharp edges. The default button has a blue dotted line around it. Windows also tends to draw attention 
to more important buttons by either highlighting or making the button bigger. 
</p>

  <p>Typically the EXIT, MINIMIZE, and MAXIMIZE controls are all at the upper right hand corner of the window. </p>

  <p>Windows also color-codes a lot of their buttons. For example, RED will be used for <code>SHUT DOWN</code> because RED is a 
danger color and lets the user know that once they click that button there is no going back. YELLOW will be used for <code>LOG OFF</code>
warning the user that this is a semi-critical button. Then there are other buttons such as HELP that are a soft blue color 
because pressing them will not do anything to your program. 

<p> Windows has recently created a completely different way to display buttons, applications and commands on their screen. Clicking one
one of these buttons will navigate the user to a different page.</p>
