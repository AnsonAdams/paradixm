<p style="text-align: center"> Selecting is usually seen as blue highlights for text and a white half-opaque rim around a file icon.</p> 


<h3> Typical Behavior <small> how it usually behaves </small> </h3>

<p> When a user selects, the most typical appearance is that the item itself highlights in a different color. However for different items the selection will look different. 
</p>

<p>For text, the cursor turns into a text cursor as the mouse hovers over. When the user clicks and drags the mouse, it is then that the choosen characters highlight in a different color.
</p>

<p> For items such as folders and files, when the item is clicked the a rim halo appears around the folder to signify that the computer is currently focusing on that particular object. It is from there that the user can choose to open it and do other commands with it.</p>

<h4> Events </h4>			
<div class="row"> 	
	
	<div class="col-sm-6">
		<div class="well"> 
			<p> <b> Text selection </b>: When text-selecting the major actions is clicking, dragging, and letting go. 
				<ul>
					<li> Click: The click signifies the beginning of the selection. As the user is hovering over the text, the mouse cursor will then turn into a text cursor. That is usually the sign that a user is able to do a text selection. Another event that occurs due to clicking is after the user has made their selection if they click without holding down the command or shift keys they will unselet that particular item. </li>

					<li> Dragging: From the starting point, the user drags along the text to the last point of where they would like to select. Whereever the mouse hovers during this dragging state is what is selected. </li> 

					<li> Letting go: When the user reaches the end of their selection, by letting go they signify that that is the end of what they choose. At this point the cursor now turns back into a normal mouse cursor and the text that they would like to select is in blue. It is from this step that the user can do whatever action they would like with the text, whether that is copying it to the clipboard etc. </li>
				</ul>
			</p> 
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class= "col-sm-6">
		<div class="well"> 
			<p> <b> File selection</b>: File selecting is very similar to the text selection except the major event is clicking.</p> 
			<ul>
				<li> Click: When the user clicks on the icon that they would like, that is when the item highlights and it signifies that it is selected. For most computers, when holding down shift and command keys, more items can be selected. When a file is seleected, if a user clicks on an area that is not another file or the same sort of icon, it will deselect the selection. </li>
			</ul>

<h3> Variants <small> how it varies per location </small> </h3>
	<p> Though the act of selecting is very similar, how it displays can be different depending on the user preference. In a computer interface, selecting is done primarily with clicking and dragging. Meanwhile for touch devices, selecting is done primarily with taps and holds. 
	</p> 
	<p>
		Depending on the user preferences, selecting's apperance may change to different colors. 
	</p>

<h3> Priority Metrics <small> Selecting and its Usability Metrics </small> </h3>

	<p> Selecting is something in which learnability, memorability, as well as errors are very important metrics. Users use selecting to do other functions and being able to quickly select to go to the next action is very important. Being able to learn how to select quickly as well as efficiently is important. Also because selecting is a prior action needed for other commands such as copying or moving files, the quicker it is to get selection done is also very important (efficiency). Also if the user has not done this in a while this information should be easily recalled (memorability). Errors should also be very low, for if there are any errors in selection it could lead to dire consequences such as deleting files or overwriting data. 
	</P> 
	<p> The only metric that is not as important is satisfaction. This is because selecting is a much more utilitarian action and component and the user's enjoyment does not vary with selecing. The user could get annoyed if selecting is not memorable or efficient but the act of selecting does not need satsifaction for it to be a great component. </p> 

<h3> Key Chararacteristics <small> What do all great selections have? </small> </h3>
	 <ul>
	 	<li> Prevent Errors: Users should be forgiven if they select the wrong items. They should be able to deselect objects that they no longer need or add more selections. </li>
	 	<li> Feedback: When trying to select, the user should get immediate feedback as to what he or she is selecting. Also they should know if what they are tapping/clicking is selectable. That way the user's mental model of selectable items will be consistent to the designer's mental model. </li>
	 	<li>Consistency: The actions that are required for selecting a certain type of object should be consistent that way selecting will have a higher level of memorability as well as efficiency. If they were different then it will confuse the user and complicate their mental model of selecting. </li>
	 	<li> Shortcuts: To help with the efficiency of selecting, shortcuts should be added to allow users to select a large amount of objects at once. For example, control+A is a common shortcut that is used to select all of the text. </li>
	 </ul>

				<li>Users can change the highlight color by going into the System Preferences > General Settings </li>
				<li>Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for OSX also highlight the general key characteristics such as: </li>
				<ul>
					<li>Direct Manipulation: As the user selects the text, it is always visible including dragging and dropping text. </li> 
					<li>User Control: The user is the one intiating the actions being done such as selecting etc.</li>

			<h3> iOS iPhone4s </h3>
			<p> For iOS, selecting is a little tricker. Unlike on a laptop where a user is able to click and drag, the user must use a combinations of different taps, holds, and drags in order to select different items. Also for iOS the only selection items are texts and images. Unlike computers, there are no files, instead they are apps that one must tap to open. </p>
			<h4> Appearance</h4>
			<p>User clicks and holds down in front of text and a magnifying like glass appears showing where the text selector is. </p>
			<img src="images/iphone_textSelection1.png" style= "height: 50%; width:50%;" class="img-responsive" alt="text selection in notes image 1">
			<p> After releasing hold, an option for Selecting and other options appear, as seen in the image below.</p>
			<img src="images/iphone_textSelection2.png" style= "height: 50%; width:50%;"class="img-responsive" alt="text selection in notes image 2">
			<p>After tapping on select, the user is able to tap and drag either ends of the selecting blue vertical bars and move them around to make their selection</p>
			<img src="images/iphone_textSelection3.png" style= "height: 50%; width:50%;"class="img-responsive" alt="text selection in notes image 3">
			<p> When there is no more action, a dialog menu pops up asking for what action the user would like to do next.</p>
			<img src="images/iphone_textSelection4.png" style= "height: 50%; width:50%;"class="img-responsive" alt="text selection in notes image 4">
			<p> Though the actions are different, the events as well as the Priority metrics are the same. </p>
			<p> Also very similary to the Human Interface Guidelines for OSX, the iOS guidelines highlight similar key characteristics: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Feedback: With the use of slight highlights whenever a user taps or uses gestures </li>
				<li> Direct Manipulation </li> 
				<li> User Control </li>
