<p>These are sliders are very common to users. However, there are many other different types of sldiers that have particular function. There are vertical sliders, radial sliders, sliders without tick marks (because it does not appear to point to a specific value, no need for tick marks for example volume, tick marks are used when users need to know the approximate value of setting as shown in the figure above for Windows 8 tick marks are helpful here to determine a specific resolution size, and ofcourse moving the slider knob/thumb to the left will always minimize the setting.</p>
