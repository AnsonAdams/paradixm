<p class="lead">Menus are probably the second most used components on a given graphical interface after buttons.</p>

<div class="row">

        <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Menus have been the go-to method for displaying (and hiding) lists of options for decades</p>
            [Place a photo of menus here.]
            <p>And like these examples, they tend to follow the standard form of having items listed from top to
                bottom with anywhere between 1 to around 25 items to choose from.</p>

            <p>Of course, these items can often be menus within menus.</p>

        <h3>Typical Placements</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Menus are usually located on the "edges" of graphical interfaces. For example, the Mac OS X
                graphical interface provides menus at the top of the Desktop screen that are always available.</p>

        <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>On most platforms, menus are usually accessed by first clicking on a button.</p>

          <p>The menus then expand to reveal the items it holds.</p>

        <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
        
        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p>As for most components on a graphical interface, feedback to the user is a crucial aspect of Don Norman's Stages-of-Action Model, specifically for when the user is attempting to perceive the system state and evaluate its outcomes.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
          <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
            the action that triggers the button</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>These attributes of standard menus across platforms has allowed much more choice and accessibility to
        be included in a single page (or single interface), as opposed to requiring users to constantly switch
        to different windows or screens each time they access a new item.</blockquote>

        <h3>Variants</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><em>Menu items</em> are very close to buttons in behavior—they perform individual action elements upon simple
            invocation by a user. However, they belong to a broader context/structure of a menu, and look sufficiently
            different that they are both conceptually and programmatically viewed as distinct from buttons.</li>

          <li><em>Italicized words!</em> (and some more words)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Events</h4>

        <blockquote>An <em>event</em> is something that can happen to a user interface component. They are both conceptual and
          highly concrete in that events very frequently translate directly into a user interface component’s API.</blockquote>

        

        <h4>State Diagram</h4>

        <blockquote>
          <p>A state diagram indicating the actions and states of a user interface component.</p>

          <p>This is most likely an image. Bonus props if you use SVG.</p>

          <p>And also, a state diagram implies, well, <em>states</em>. So be sure to describe them. Note also that there will
            usually be overlap between a component’s events and its state diagram. A sufficiently detailed state diagram,
            however, may have more activities than the “public” events that can be reported by a component.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Most button designs have the following states. The <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> states can be
          viewed as “dormant” button states—they are the only states that a button can have when a user is not interacting with
          it. The <code>enabled</code> state means that a user <em>can</em> interact with it, while the <code>disabled</code>
          state means that a user <em>cannot</em> do so.</p>

        <p>When a button is <code>enabled</code>, additional states may be triggered. Not all states are present in all button
          implementations, but in general they are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>hover</code>: For platforms with an explicit pointing element, positioning that element over a button may
            change the button’s appearance. This provides a form of feedback that states that the button will respond if
            additional activity is performed.</li>

          <li><code>armed</code>: If the user initiates button-triggered behavior, such as a click on mouse-capable systems,
            the button may enter a state indicating that it is ready to be invoked. Many button implementations allow an “out”
            from this state, in case the user changes his or her mind in mid-action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Component in Action</h4>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Embedded or linked video (by you or by others [and if by others give credit]) showing the component in action.</p>

          <p>For components that are available on a web platform, you can embed an actual component right here, such as:</p>

        <p class="text-center">
          <button class="btn btn-default">Standard Bootstrap Button</button>
          <button class="btn btn-default disabled">Disabled Bootstrap Button</button>

        <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

        <blockquote>Talk about the five usability metrics in relation to this component. Not all components will have the same
          metric priorities. For example:</blockquote>
